## Grad Cap
My high school graduation cap.

The cap included a blinking multicolor LED, a button to turn on and off the LED, a rotating servo, a potentiometer to control the LCD screen brightness, and an LCD screen.

The LCD screen had the stock price of SpaceX (albeit it is privateâ€”so not traded in realtime), the current uptime of the program (I think it reached over 10,000 seconds during my graduation, even though I unplugged and plugged it in again halfway through), and the current temperature from a voltage sensor (which wasn't following other formulas to convert to temperature, so I made a quick experimentally derived equation, which was also inaccurate).

I had a wire running down my back (for the power) the whole time.

Also, my grandma took these incredible shots of me with the cap:
