## Grad Cap
My high school graduation cap.

The cap included a blinking multicolor LED, a button to turn on and off the LED, a rotating servo, a potentiometer to control the LCD screen brightness, and an LCD screen.

The LCD screen had the stock price of SpaceX (albeit it is privateâ€”so not traded in realtime), the current uptime of the program (I think it reached over 10,000 seconds during my graduation, even though I unplugged and plugged it in again halfway through), and the current temperature from a voltage sensor (which wasn't following other formulas to convert to temperature, so I made a quick experimentally derived equation, which was also inaccurate).

I had a wire running down my back (for the power) the whole time.

Also, my grandma took these incredible shots of me with the cap:

## Grad Cap
This is my high school graduation cap project.

The cap included:
- A blinking multicolor LED, with a button to turn it on and off.
- A rotating servo.
- A potentiometer to control the brightness of an LCD screen.
- The LCD screen displayed:
  - The stock price of SpaceX (though the data was not real-time, as SpaceX is privately traded).
  - The current uptime of the program, which reached over 10,000 seconds during the ceremony (despite being unplugged halfway through).
  - The current temperature, measured by a voltage sensor. I used an experimentally derived equation to convert the voltage to temperature, though it was not entirely accurate.

There was also a wire running down my back to power the system throughout the ceremony.

My grandma took these amazing photos of me wearing the cap:
